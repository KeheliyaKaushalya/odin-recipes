    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This <strong>Chocolate Ice Cream</strong> is a rich, custard-style ice cream flavored with semisweet chocolate and cocoa powder.</p>
        <p>This chocolate ice cream recipe is <em>rich, sweet, creamy, and easy to make</em> with just eight ingredients you likely 
            already have on hand.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Milk</strong>: This easy ice cream recipe starts with a cup of milk.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Sweeten things up with ¾ cup white sugar.</li>
            <li><strong>Cocoa powder</strong>: Unsweetened cocoa powder gives this ice cream a chocolatey base.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won’t make the ice cream taste salty.</li>
            <li><strong>Egg yolks</strong>: This custard-like chocolate ice cream requires three lightly beaten egg yolks.</li>
            <li><strong>Chocolate</strong>: Chopped semisweet chocolate takes the decadence up a notch. </li>
            <li><strong>Heavy cream</strong>: You’ll need two cups of heavy cream.</li>
            <li><strong>Vanilla</strong>: A teaspoon of vanilla extract adds complexity and enhances the flavor.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring the milk, sugar, cocoa, and salt to a simmer in a saucepan. </li>
            <li>Whisk ½ of the milk mixture into the yolks, return to the pan, and stir until thickened.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and stir in chopped chocolate.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate in a chilled bowl until cold.</li>
